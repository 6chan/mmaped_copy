# mmaped_copy
(EXPERIMENTAL) MMap memory file copy

CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK, STILL EXPERIMENTAL, IT DOES NOT WORK, ONLY COPIES THE FIRST 512 AND LAST 512 BYTES, MEANING THE THREADS ARE WORKING. IM WORKING TO FIX THIS ASAP SO CHILL.

Program designned to copy bytes form input file to output file, with optional offset values and focused on speed.
Made by me, a student interessted by this sort of stuff, with the main pourpose to make something cool and to learn more about memory writting and C++ in the process. The code you see now if far, far from complete, ill change pieces of it and replace it from time to time. Every commit should be working, and at the maxium it would give you compiller warnings, but should work fine, I dont guarantee it tho :) If you encounter anny bug and would like to report it, my discord is is my bio, i should reply within 1 hour to 1 day.

KEEP IN MIND that the speed of wich this code creates your file depends (alot) of what operative system you're using,
how your kernel intereacts with calls, how much RAM you have in total and available at the runtime, your hardware (type of RAM
and disk), and the weather outside.

Goes without saying, annyone is free to contribute to this code, message me and send the changes and ill take a look at them, test and
if they do better ill update the repository.

Thanks for reading.
